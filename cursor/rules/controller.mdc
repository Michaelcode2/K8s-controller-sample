## What We Built:
Kubernetes Controller CLI that can:
- Show deployment status (replicas, availability, readiness)
- Display recent events in a namespace
- Watch for real-time deployment changes
- Connect to any Kubernetes cluster via kubeconfig

## Key features:

- Real-time monitoring with watch functionality
- Namespace filtering with -n flag
- Event logging showing recent cluster events
- Deployment status with replica counts and availability
- Error handling with proper user feedback

## Key Implementation Steps:

- Add Kubernetes dependencies (client-go, apimachinery, api)
- Create controller command with proper Cobra integration
